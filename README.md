# 🌈 Inspiration 🌈

Everyday,we as a society try to work towards becoming more inclusive,promoting self acceptance.But more often than not,I've seen my friends more hindered to accept themselves before others accept them.As a cinephile myself,I know firsthand how movies and cinema can build your esteem,give you a wider perspective,a canvas to empathise with.So,to provide a person with a platform to find exclusively lgbtq+ movies,save them and maybe take away a fresher perspective is how the idea came into being!
